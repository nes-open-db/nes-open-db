After an accident while testing an experimental warp drive, you find yourself stranded in an uncharted area of the universe. Your only chance of getting home is to recover  your four warp cores (jettisoned during the accident) and then return to the wormhole  that brought you here in order to get back to warp speed and back to Earth. Unfortunately this part of the universe is inhabited by six alien races - some nice,  some not-so-nice. You can barter and battle with these as you see fit, although be  careful - your actions will have consequences, and beating up an easy mark can make  them less likely to deal with you the next time your paths cross. Complicating matters more is the fact that your long-range scanners are broken so you  can't see what's ahead of you until you enter a region. Your ship is also a little underpowered and can only carry a certain amount of fuel and armaments. However, it's possible to use the few supplies you have to earn money, which you can then use to replenish stocks or improve your ship. And out in the darkness of space, perhaps there are other opportunities awaiting you? But don't take too long. The wormhole will close soon, and once that happens you'll be trapped here forever!","screenshots":["/roms/zxspectrum/breakspace/screenshots/breakspace.png"],"detailsLink":"/roms/zxspectrum/breakspace/","romLink":"/roms/zxspectrum/breakspace/breakspace.tap","authorString":"Blerkotron","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1},{"added":"2019-02-11","key":"cadaverion","platform":"zxspectrum","title":"Cadaverion","released":"2013-10-14","description":"Help Cheril in the sixth game in the Cheril Trilogy!

If you get it wrong you can always restart the room by pressing \"fire\" over the blueish tile you will find in every room with statues. This will revert the room to the original position. You must hurry, because if the time runs out you'll have to start the current floor over.

To get/interchange objects press DOWN. Besides, you'll have to give those objects a use. To use an object, just walk to the place you want to use it and press DOWN. For Cheril to fly, she has to \"push\". You can make her \"push\" by pressing UP. But beware: \"pushing\" for too long drains Cheril's vitality, so you have to do this carefully. Timing short \"pushes\" can make her gain momentum. Take your time to master the technique, it won't take long. Cheril can also fire power balls. You can fire pressing FIRE. Power balls also drain Cheril, but think that enemies do quite a lot of harm. Use this feature wisely, and just when needed! Cheril can also regain her vitality by means of a special action we won't reveal 'cause it's easy enough to find out!

As in the beautiful traditional stories, we have to rescue the princess dam in the pyramid. To get to it we have to go advancing rooms. Each room is a level and the closer we are the more difficult it will be for us to pass because the stones that we will have to remove will be more and more, they will fall faster and the time decreasing. But not everything is bad news, every time we move from room we get 10 extra seconds and each time we remove stones in quantity greater than three, we also get extra time.
