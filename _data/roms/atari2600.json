You have been commissioned by the resistance to steal these pods from the Empire's storage planets. Each planet is defended by a battery of \"Limpet\" guns, powered by a nuclear power plant. By firing shots at the power plant, the guns can be temporarily disabled; the more shots fired at the nuclear reactor, the longer the guns will take to recharge. BUT BEWARE!! If you fire too many shots at the reactor, it will become critical, giving you just ten seconds to clear the planet before it is destroyed. If you have not already retrieved the pod stored at that planet, then you will have failed the mission. If you have retrieved the pod, and you manage to send the reactor into its critical phase, and leave the planet safely, you will receive a hefty bonus. Further into the Empire's system, you will encounter planets with REVERSE GRAVITY and something even more deadly...",
