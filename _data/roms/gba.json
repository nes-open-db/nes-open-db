The puzzle lies in the process of revealing the picture. To reveal the picture, you are given hints as to blocks of continuous pixels. Each block of pixels is listed by row and by column. You are to use these numbers to help you reveal the picture. The number hints are like clues in a crossword puzzle - hence the name Picross! Now, this game is different than similar types of picross games. There is a lower time limit in this game. However, you are allowed to use items that you collect to help reveal the puzzle. It is a more franctic game that causes you to think just a little faster than with other puzzle games. And so we have Battle Picross! CONTROLS: You mainly control the chizzel tool on the puzzle surface. You use the chizzel to to reveal the puzzle. To chizzel a part of the puzzle, position the tool accordingly, and then press the A button. If you know that a certain tile is not part of the puzzle, it is wise to mark it with an \"X\" so that you don't forget this fact. To do this, press the B button. Marking \"X\"s on the puzzle is not required to win the puzzle. It is only there to help you remember which tiles are not part of the picture. You can use items to help you reveal the picture. To do this, slide in your items window with the R button. While holding the R button, select the desired item with the cursor keys and press the A button. If you do not wish to use an item, just let go of the R button instead. You have to obtain items by completing puzzles.","screenshots":["/roms/gba/battlepicross/screenshots/battlepicross.png"],"detailsLink":"/roms/gba/battlepicross/","romLink":"/roms/gba/battlepicross/battlepicross.gba","authorString":"Sean Reid","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1},{"added":"2019-02-11","key":"blastarenaadvance","platform":"gba","title":"BLAST ARENA ADVANCE","released":"2005-05-31","description":"Very professionally put together abstract/retro styled action game.
