And at each turn the player needs to choose one of two options, where to turn the steering wheel relative to the driver: to the right or to the left. The game is complicated by the fact that the player needs to mentally represent the position of the car and at what turn it is now. After passing several turns the car reaches the finish line, after which it moves to the next more difficult level. From level to level, only the number of turns is added; changes route.",
