Deep, deep in outer space... but what part of outer space isn't deep or far away anyway?

This is the story of the two metal hawks, Ruby and Cobalt. While floating through space, 
they happened upon the bird sanctuary planet of Toal. The observatory space station and 
surface of the planet were being devoured by a swarm of space insects. Using bits granted 
to the by the phantom bird of planet Toal, the metal hawks wiped out the invaders. 
Ruby and Cobalt then perched on to a mountain top and turned to stone.

Hundreds of orbits of the planet have passed. The space insects have returned with a 
device called the Buzzstar. It has the power to burn the atmosphere off of a planet. 
The old observatory space station is already infested, and the Buzzstar is close. 
Ruby and Cobalt return to their original form and fly off to meet the invaders once again.

Can the metal hawks conquer 7 stages with wave after wave of invaders and giant screen filling bosses?
