You are a pilot of the plane.. You can fly around, shoot things, pick up coins and blast through walls with the charge attack. 

These past few months I've been steadily working on Goplanes, a game for the Sega Genesis. Written in C using the SGDK. 

The main thread on Sprites Mind, is here --> http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1090

*********** EDIT: January 4th, 2013 ***************

A bit of unfortunate news.

I'm stopping all development for this project. Art and videos will also be taken down.

I wish and hope to revisit this project again, but won't be happening any time soon.

Thanks for watching,
DJCC.
