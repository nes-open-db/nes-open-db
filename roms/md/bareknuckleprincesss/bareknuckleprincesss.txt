Hot blooded princess brawler for your Sega Mega Drive system. 

Made in a week for the #bitbitjam3 compo.

Princess Linear, the fair and loved princess of Bitland has been openly shamed by Princess Plum of Polygosia, accused of fraternising with lower class men & women.

The ancients decree that the only way to resolve matters of this kind is trial by combat! So the 3rd Royal Rumble takes place!

Step forth Princess Linear, and defend your home lands honour,  in the ring!

CONTROLS

In Bare Knuckled Princess you control Princess Linear with the Mega Drive Control Pad.

Moving the d-pad left or right will move Princess Linear around the ring.

Pressing the d-pad down will initiate a block, shielding you from the enemy attacks.

The A Button slaps to the left of Princess Linear.
The B Button slaps to the right of Princess Linear.

Watch out for Princess Plum, she has all the same moves as you, and can parry your attacks! 

This game requires an emulator to play! Tested with Kega Fusion.
