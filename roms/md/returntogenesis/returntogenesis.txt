Return To Genesis

Take 12 scientists.
Clone them 50 times. Distribute them on 50 planets. Set them to work.
Result : THE GENESIS PROJECT
For years the scientists tolled to produce products and medicines that are now taken for granted. 
Then one by one the planets were overrun by MECHANAUTS and the scientists forced into slavery. 
Now the Mechanauts themselves are at war. Their armies are away, the occupied planets barely defended.
NOW IT IS YOUR CHANCE ! Rescue all of the scientists from the planets. 
Some of the scientists may bring their latest project with them to aid you in your mission.
GO! NOW IS TIME to RETURN TO GENESIS !
