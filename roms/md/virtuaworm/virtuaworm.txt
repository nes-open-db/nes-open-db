Like pac-man crossd with snake. Navigate the mazes, but don't run in to yourself! Basically a clone of an old web game called nibblet.

We've had virtua cop, fighter, tennis, and racing. Now it's time for Virtua Worm!

Gameplay:
The game is like a cross between snake and pac-man. It's essentially a clone of an old web game called nibblet. Check it out if you haven't played it before!
You have to navigate through a maze while eating food pellets. Each piece of food adds a body segment. The goal is to eat every piece of food in the stage without running in to yourself.

There are 15 stages in total. Hopefully the difficulty curve is okay. It's kind of hard to judge which levels are hardest when you're the one who made them.
The art style is the same for all 15, but the color and music changes every 5 levels.

Hope you enjoy it. It was a lot of fun making it.

Other stuff:
The game was programmed in 68k assembly.
I tried to have a consistent music style between levels instead of the anything goes type I usually use.
The title screen was done in blender 3D. Too bad the quality got butchered.
