Sega Genesis development - Gen Poker

My first attempt at a video poker game was at around twelve years of age, using BASIC on an 8-bit ZX Spectrum. 
I programmed it without using arrays, instead writing pages and pages of "if" statements. It was terribly buggy, 
a fact which I tried to hide by telling my friends who played it that the game was actually cheating in THEIR favour... heh

Video poker machines were interesting because they usually took up a half of each arcade in Bucharest. 
Half of the arcade had the regular games, and the other half had gambling machines, predominantly video poker. 
Adults lost piles of money playing these things.

If you just want to play it, grab the rom, and off you go! If you wish to develop your own Sega Genesis game, 
download the modified dev kit, and read the rest of the article. 	

The rules are simple: get a winning hand, and then either gamble a few times, trying to guess whether the next 
card is red or black, or just collect. Correct guesses will double your amount won. Guessing incorrectly takes away your winnings. 
You can collect whatever you won at any time.
