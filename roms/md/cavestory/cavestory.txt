Cave Story MD (洞窟物語 Dōkutsu Monogatari) (doukutsu-v0.5.1)

This is a rewrite/port of the popular freeware game Cave Story for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. 
It should work on any console or emulator*. It's fairly stable at this point but gets buggier as the game progresses.

(*) Genesis Plus GX crashes at startup. This is the only emulator known to have the issue.


Gameplay
The player controls the on-screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. 
The player progresses by navigating platform game puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon.
When the player collects multiple weapons, they may be toggled at any time with the press of a button. 
Defeating enemies sometimes yields yellow triangular objects, which give experience points to weapons when collected. 
Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels.
Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. 
The player must interact with a variety of non-player characters and objects to complete the game. 

Control Defaults

If you have a 6 button controller:

    C - Jump, confirm
    B - Shoot
    A - Fast forward through scripted events
    Y, Z - Switch weapon
    Start - Pause / Item Menu

For 3 button, A cycles through weapons. The rest is the same.
Cheats

    Stage Select: up, down, left, right, A + Start. Like Sonic.
    Infinite health/ammo: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, A + Start.

You can still get crushed and fall out of bounds.

Note that you can't load or save the game while cheating (including the counter).


Thanks

CS Engine and NXengine-based AI routines - GPLv3

Consider all code except those explicitly mentioned above (and their respective headers) to to GPLv3. Most of the code 
in this engine is original, except for the AI routines in src/ai/. Even is places where an AI function is entirely different, 
NXEngine's version was still used as a starting point. There are other bits and pieces I took, such as the booster code,
 proper speeds/logic for weapons, etc.

All created by Pixel, unless specified otherwise. I used them without permission. You absolutely can't use these in anything 
commercial. Nicalis owns the exclusive rights (in the west at least). Not to mention it would be pretty disrespectful to the 
original creator.

Most of these are created by me in Deflemask and are CC-BY-NC (give me credit, and don't use it in a commercial product).

A few were remade or modified DavisOlivier. No license was mentioned. Ask them if you want to use these in something:

    Cave Story
    Eyes of Flame
    Gestation
    Gravity
    Fanfare 1 / 2 / 3

Fonts

The font used in the Title Screen menus, in-game dialogue, and crash messages was made by Sik. Ask him if you want to use them.
