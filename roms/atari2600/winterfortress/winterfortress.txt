This is an early, pre-cartridge version of the game available for testing.

Six pesky little penguin chicks have run off and gotten lost in the mysterious ruins. 
You are the only one brave enough to rescue them! Roll snowballs by holding down the 
fire button and letting go to smash them against the iceblocks. Only larger snowballs 
will break the blocks. But don't get too close; this ice is so cold, you will be frozen 
solid if you touch it! If this wasn't bad enough, all this activity has awakened the old 
sentinals. Avoid their eerie mechanical movements by throwing snowballs at them. But be 
quick about it because they will start rebuilding their fortress with new blocks! 
If you can save six chicks without getting frozen, you are rewarded with an extra penguin
