THE GAME
--------
The resistance is about to launch a major offensive against the Intergalactic
Empire. In preparation for this, they have captured several battle-grade starships,
but they lack the essential power sources for these formidable craft; Klystron
Pods.
You have been commissioned by the resistance to steal these pods from the
Empire's storage planets. Each planet is defended by a battery of "Limpet"
guns, powered by a nuclear power plant. By firing shots at the power plant,
the guns can be temporarily disabled; the more shots fired at the nuclear reactor,
the longer the guns will take to recharge. BUT BEWARE!! If you fire too many
shots at the reactor, it will become critical, giving you just ten seconds to clear
the planet before it is destroyed. If you have not already retrieved the pod
stored at that planet, then you will have failed the mission. If you have retrieved
the pod, and you manage to send the reactor into its critical phase, and leave
the planet safely, you will receive a hefty bonus.
Further into the Empire's system, you will encounter planets with REVERSE
GRAVITY and something even more deadly...


PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
You can control your ship with the standard joystick:
LEFT    = ROTATE SHIP ANTICLOCKWISE
RIGHT   = ROTATE SHIP CLOCKWISE
FIRE    = FIRE (THRUST while joystick is DOWN)
UP      = THRUST
DOWN    = ACTIVATE TRACTOR BEAMS/EXTERNAL SHIELDS
SELECT  = SELECT GAME VARIATION
RESET   = ABORT GAME

The Omega Booster Grip buttons are also supported:
Trigger = FIRE
Booster = THRUST

Use the RIGHT DIFFICULTY switch to adjust colors for NTSC- or PAL-TVs.

To collect a Klystron Pod, hover just above the pod, activate the tractor beam,
and thrust away from the pod. When the automatic tow-bar has fixed to the
pod, you can deactivate the tractor beam.
To collect fuel, hover above a fuel cell, and activate the tractor beam.

GAME SELECT MATRIX
------------------
THRUST includes five game variations. Press the GAME SELECT switch until the
number appears on the very left of the score display.

Number             |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |   5    |
-------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--------+
Planets            | 1-6 | 3-8 | 1-6 | 3-8 |  1-6   |
Difficulty Level   |  Normal   |  Expert   | Rookie |
Lives              |  4        |  3        | 5      |
Fuel               |  1000     |  500      | 2000   |
Rotate Ship        |  normal   |  normal   | slow   |
Atmosphere Density |  low      |  zero     | high   |
Gun Fire           |  medium   |  high     | low    |

The difficulty level Rookie is limited to the planets 1 to 6 and normal or reverse
gravity. If you want to experience the other planets and the "even more deadly"
factor, you have to master the game at a higher difficulty.

After all missions of difficulty level Rookie (12 missions) or Normal (24 missions)
are completed the difficulty increases to the next level.

You shouldn't try to cheat the game, if you want to reach the end.
