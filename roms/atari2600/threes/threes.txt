Note: Rules for my Threes! variant (called THREE·S = 3 dots):

    A new game starts with RESET
    Move the joystick to shift the tiles by one
    Press fire for undo (once!)
    '.' can only merged with ':'; resulting into a 0
    Digits with the same number can be merged, resulting into the next higher digit
    Whenever tiles are moved a new tile is created
    The new tile appears at an empty space in the column/row opposite to the move direction 
    Initially the new tile can only be a '.', ':' or '0'
    After you reached a '4' you will sometimes get a higher bonus tile, which is between '1' and your highest tile number / 4.
    You get points for merging tiles, scores tripple for each higher number
    The game ends when no tile can be moved
