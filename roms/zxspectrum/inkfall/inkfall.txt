Simple puzzle game.

Choose an ink colour from palette on the right.  Use QA, OP, 67 to move cursor, and Space or 0 to action.  

Ink will fill from left to right and top to bottom.

Try to fill whole page in one colour.

Be sure to choose a colour before the time runs out.

Once colour is actioned, all adjacent same colours will fill with new colour.  When a different colour is hit, the fill will stop.

You can not use the last chosen colour on your next go (last colour is highlighted and will be skipped over on cursor move)

Try to complete in the lowest amount of move to gain a Lo-Score.
