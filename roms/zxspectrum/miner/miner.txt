Miner'49er - ZX Spectrum
by Bootlegger
Published	Jun 16, 2017
For ZX Spectrum

Here is an emulator snapshot of a game I wrote in basic back in the 80's called Miner 49'er.
Thought it was great back in the day, but realise now that it suffered a few bugs and was painfully slow 8)
Must be run in 48k Mode emualtor.

The idea of the game is to collect all of the gold bags before your time runs out. As well you have to dodge 
the ghost of the dead miner that roams the caverns. They chase you and try to stop you getting the gold. 

Keys:
O/P: left/right
M: climb
H: help
Good luck, you'll need it!
