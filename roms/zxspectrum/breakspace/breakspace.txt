Break/Space (Break-Space v1.9.tap)

Break/Space is a procedurally-generated space strategy game for the 48K ZX Spectrum. 
The original version was written entirely in BASIC for the 2017 ZX Spectrum BASIC Jam 
(https://itch.io/jam/zx-spectrum-basic-jam), but the latest release has been compiled 
into 100% machine code for a slicker gameplay experience.

After an accident while testing an experimental warp drive, you find yourself stranded 
in an uncharted area of the universe. Your only chance of getting home is to recover 
your four warp cores (jettisoned during the accident) and then return to the wormhole 
that brought you here in order to get back to warp speed and back to Earth.

Unfortunately this part of the universe is inhabited by six alien races – some nice, 
some not-so-nice. You can barter and battle with these as you see fit, although be 
careful – your actions will have consequences, and beating up an easy mark can make 
them less likely to deal with you the next time your paths cross.

Complicating matters more is the fact that your long-range scanners are broken so you 
can’t see what’s ahead of you until you enter a region. Your ship is also a little 
underpowered and can only carry a certain amount of fuel and armaments. However, it’s 
possible to use the few supplies you have to earn money, which you can then use to 
replenish stocks or improve your ship. And out in the darkness of space, perhaps there 
are other opportunities awaiting you?

But don’t take too long. The wormhole will close soon, and once that happens you’ll 
be trapped here forever!

Updated to version 1.9 (12/09/17).
