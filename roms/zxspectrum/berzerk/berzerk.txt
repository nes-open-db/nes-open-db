Heavily uses the Currah Microspeech engine so recommend you find either spectaculator or zxspin for emulation, or real hardware to play it.

Aim of game;
Navigate the play field avoiding all robots.  Take too long and a smiler will come to trance on you!
Shoot the enemies if you wish.  Enemies will always track towards you
Avoid wall at all costs.
Follow direction of arrow to try to escape the maze.
Enemies will fire back after a few moves, and will gradually get more aggressive.
End sequence if you escape, not just a simple well done message....
Use QAOP and space to move and fire.
