Flappy Bird

It's hard!! Even at easy... Doh...
Flappy Bird is a one button game where you need to get a bird trough pipes, while not colliding with it. 
As said there is only one button, so with this button you can give your bird some height, but the height is being reduced immediate again. 
So you need to keep clicking and keep the correct height, which isn't easy at all.
