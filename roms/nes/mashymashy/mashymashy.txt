This straddles the line between game and tool. It is for testing mash speed. 
You set a mash button (A, B, Start, Select or “B with down” to simulate Ninja Gaiden Jaquio mashing. You set a time limit (1, 2, 5 or 10 seconds). 
Once time is complete, it will display number of buttons mashed and the rate of button pushes per second.
