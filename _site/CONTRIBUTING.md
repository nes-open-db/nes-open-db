You are very welcome to contribute to this database! If you are an owner of freely licensed NES software, or are
aware of such software that could be distributed on this site, please open up an issue on the issue tracker of
this repository. If possible, provide the full ROM data along with any useful metadata of the software and
evidence of what kind of licensing the software has. If all data is not available, you may still open up an
issue and we can figure things out from there.

It is absolutely essential for this project that the license of the software allows for free distribution of
the game through our platform, so we require solid evidence or preferably a signed waiver (a template is being drafted in `docs/AGREEMENT.md`) from the owner of the software themselves. This agreement or other sufficient evidence is to be provided for each piece of software to
be added to the database. If the licensing terms are unclear, we cannot distribute it, even if the software is otherwise
widely available on the internet.
