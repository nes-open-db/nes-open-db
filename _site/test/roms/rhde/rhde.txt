RHDE: Furniture Fight
by Damian Yerrick

It is the story of a neighborhood rivalry that got w-a-y out of hand. Trampling each other's gardens was only the beginning. 
Soon they were shooting off model rockets to blow holes in the walls of the house across the street.
A 2-player battle for the ultimate home. Steal furniture, destroy walls, and perfect your Feng Shui for max points.
