That's Whack!
by Sly Dog Studios

Similar to the classic game of Whack-A-Mole, you must pop the dummy when they show themselves from behind the pipes.
Push in the direction that they appear at to successfully knock them back down. Hit 100 of them and you win the game, but miss 5 of them and it’s game over.
They will get progressively faster, so keep on your toes!
