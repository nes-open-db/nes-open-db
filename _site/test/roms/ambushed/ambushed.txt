Ambushed
by Sly Dog Studios

You’re walking down the street and suddenly, from a couple of attached buildings that are across the street, you are ambushed by multiple gunmen... 
Luckily you’re packin’ some heat! That’s the premise of this entry into the 1k Series of games. 
Use the D-Pad to move the player’s scope around, and ‘A’ to fire. Score 99 (then +1) and you win the game.
That’s a lot of baddies for one area! However, if a single bullet reaches you on the other side of the street, you’re a goner. Shoot them before they get to you!


This is a series of games that are 1,024 bytes or less in size. This means all components of the game are included in the 1k; code, graphics, sound, vectors, etc. 
These are mainly done as a challenge, because it is tough to get as much as you can within a 1k space on the NES, but it definitely helps your programming chops!
