Memory
by Sly Dog Studios

A game of memory. Very easy if you use a certain method, but here it is! Flip the cards and match them all to win the game.
Press Start to begin the game. It should go without saying to use the d-pad to move the cursor around, but there I go saying it.
The 'A' button flips them.
