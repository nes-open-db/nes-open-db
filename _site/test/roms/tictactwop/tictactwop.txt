Tic-Tac-Two-P
by Sly Dog Studios

That’s right, a good ol’ game of Tic-Tac-Toe for you and one friend to play.
The loser gets their X’s or O’s grayed out, and a stalemate results in all pieces getting the same treatment.
At the end of the game, press the Start button to reset the game.
The 1st player (X’s) always goes first, so trade controllers after each game if you feel the need!
Of course, move the icon with the Directional Pad, and lay down your tile with the A button.
Go grab a friend and get busy!
