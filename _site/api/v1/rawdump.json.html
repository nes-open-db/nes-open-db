The puzzle lies in the process of revealing the picture. To reveal the picture, you are given hints as to blocks of continuous pixels. Each block of pixels is listed by row and by column. You are to use these numbers to help you reveal the picture. The number hints are like clues in a crossword puzzle - hence the name Picross! Now, this game is different than similar types of picross games. There is a lower time limit in this game. However, you are allowed to use items that you collect to help reveal the puzzle. It is a more franctic game that causes you to think just a little faster than with other puzzle games. And so we have Battle Picross! CONTROLS: You mainly control the chizzel tool on the puzzle surface. You use the chizzel to to reveal the puzzle. To chizzel a part of the puzzle, position the tool accordingly, and then press the A button. If you know that a certain tile is not part of the puzzle, it is wise to mark it with an \"X\" so that you don't forget this fact. To do this, press the B button. Marking \"X\"s on the puzzle is not required to win the puzzle. It is only there to help you remember which tiles are not part of the picture. You can use items to help you reveal the picture. To do this, slide in your items window with the R button. While holding the R button, select the desired item with the cursor keys and press the A button. If you do not wish to use an item, just let go of the R button instead. You have to obtain items by completing puzzles.","screenshots":["/roms/gba/battlepicross/screenshots/battlepicross.png"],"detailsLink":"/roms/gba/battlepicross/","romLink":"/roms/gba/battlepicross/battlepicross.gba","authorString":"Sean Reid","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1},{"added":"2019-02-11","key":"blastarenaadvance","platform":"gba","title":"BLAST ARENA ADVANCE","released":"2005-05-31","description":"Very professionally put together abstract/retro styled action game.

Luckly, his good ol' friend Meemaid, the evil sorceress-turned-super heroine learned about the incident as she was using the ATM in the very moment the bank was being robbed. That's why they decide to head back over to the new and refurnished Storm Palace to regain the lost fortune. But it won't be easy... the new basement is deep and full of dark corners. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles. And that's what happened: Uwol and Meemaid got lost and reached in the deepest side of the labyrinth - where Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, plus the death murderer and the children's favourite Cthulhy dwell. So you may guess it won't be an easy task to escape with the money! How to play: 1. 1 Player: Control Uwol and help him to reach his goal! 2. 2 Players: Call a friend and control both Uwol and Meemaid to finish levels in cooperative mode! 3. Vs. Mode: Uwol and Meemaid compete for the coins. The winner in each level will score a point. In modes 1 and 2, two exit pads will appear at the bottom of the screen when every coin has been collected, so you can choose your path across the pyramid. Stand over either of them and press DOWN to activate. If you are playing the co-op 2 players mode, either Uwol or Meemaid can choose the path. When the time is up, Fanty will appear. Avoid it at all costs! In two player modes it will pursue the player who has collected the most coins. If a baddie touches you, you will lose your clothes. You can regain them by collecting a t-shirt which will appear somewhere in the screen. In co-op 2 players mode, an already dressed player can't pick up a new t-shirt, and if the two players lose their clothes two t-shirts will appear. In vs. mode, any player can get the t-shirt even if they don't need it to harm the opponent.
