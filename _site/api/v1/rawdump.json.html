That's why they decide to head back over to the new and refurnished Storm Palace to regain the lost fortune. But it won't be easy... the new basement is deep and full of dark corners. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles. And that's what happened: Uwol and Meemaid got lost and reached in the deepest side of the labyrinth - where Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, plus the death murderer and the children's favourite Cthulhy dwell.

How to play: 1. 1 Player: Control Uwol and help him to reach his goal! 2. 2 Players: Call a friend and control both Uwol and Meemaid to finish levels in cooperative mode! 3. Vs. Mode: Uwol and Meemaid compete for the coins. The winner in each level will score a point.
