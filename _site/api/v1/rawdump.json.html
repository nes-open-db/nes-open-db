To chizzel a part of the puzzle, position the tool accordingly, and then press the A button. If you know that a certain tile is not part of the puzzle, it is wise to mark it with an \"X\" so that you don't forget this fact. To do this, press the B button.

Luckly, his good ol' friend Meemaid, the evil sorceress-turned-super heroine learned about the incident as she was using the ATM in the very moment the bank was being robbed. That's why they decide to head back over to the new and refurnished Storm Palace to regain the lost fortune. But it won't be easy... the new basement is deep and full of dark corners. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles. And that's what happened: Uwol and Meemaid got lost and reached in the deepest side of the labyrinth - where Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, plus the death murderer and the children's favourite Cthulhy dwell. So you may guess it won't be an easy task to escape with the money! How to play: 1. 1 Player: Control Uwol and help him to reach his goal! 2. 2 Players: Call a friend and control both Uwol and Meemaid to finish levels in cooperative mode! 3. Vs. Mode: Uwol and Meemaid compete for the coins. The winner in each level will score a point. In modes 1 and 2, two exit pads will appear at the bottom of the screen when every coin has been collected, so you can choose your path across the pyramid. Stand over either of them and press DOWN to activate. If you are playing the co-op 2 players mode, either Uwol or Meemaid can choose the path. When the time is up, Fanty will appear. Avoid it at all costs! In two player modes it will pursue the player who has collected the most coins. If a baddie touches you, you will lose your clothes. You can regain them by collecting a t-shirt which will appear somewhere in the screen. In co-op 2 players mode, an already dressed player can't pick up a new t-shirt, and if the two players lose their clothes two t-shirts will appear. In vs. mode, any player can get the t-shirt even if they don't need it to harm the opponent.

This devastating work is viewed with contempt by many fringe groups in colonised space. Private security and intelligence forces are stretched to breaking point protecting those trying to tame the Red Planet. One group in particular, claiming to be allies of the 'guardian daimon' of Mars, have struck many savage blows against the colonisation effort, attacking mining facilities, dormitories, miners, engineers, scientists and their families indiscriminately. They claim that the colonisation efforts are causing irreparable damage to the natural ecosystem of Mars, and demand that humanity leave at once. Admist all this madness, a terrorist cell activates after a decade-long infiltration into the heart of colonial governance. They take a number of key colonisation personnel hostage. Their demand: the absolute abandonment of Mars by the human race within twenty-four Earth hours. The security forces deal with the immediate threat after a bloody and protracted siege... but, with his final words, the leader of the cell leaves a chilling warning... \"You may think you have won, but you can -never- win. We have planted a nuclear device in the heart of Mars. A device capable of annihilating the entire planet.\" \"The bomb is armed.\" This is where you come in. You are an ace pilot. The best.

As in the beautiful traditional stories, we have to rescue the princess dam in the pyramid. To get to it we have to go advancing rooms. Each room is a level and the closer we are the more difficult it will be for us to pass because the stones that we will have to remove will be more and more, they will fall faster and the time decreasing. But not everything is bad news, every time we move from room we get 10 extra seconds and each time we remove stones in quantity greater than three, we also get extra time.

Each player has 2 limited special abilities that you may use to help advance through the level. The in-game status bar displays the name of each ability and how many times it can be used during that level.\\nFor example, Apple's two abilities are CARDKEY and SCREAM. Using CARDKEY next to a door will cause it to open and detract one CARDKEY point (you need at least one point to open a door). Her SCREAM stuns nearby enemies for a short period of time.\\nAll three players must be alive and to the exit to complete the level. If you get yourself stuck, press START to pause and then SELECT to restart the level.\\nAfter you complete each level a 4 letter password is given to you so that you may resume the game using the Password option at the title screen, after your system has been shut off.","screenshots":["/roms/snes/saf/screenshots/saf.png"],"detailsLink":"/roms/snes/saf/","romLink":"/roms/snes/saf/saf.smc","authorString":"Mukunda Johnson, Ken Snyder, Steven Velema, Hubert Lamontagne","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1},{"added":"2019-02-11","key":"superbossgaiden","platform":"snes","title":"Super Boss Gaiden","released":"2009-06-01","description":"This game is so much fun, wreck 'em all enemies in your way is so cool, the music is so great too.","screenshots":["/roms/snes/superbossgaiden/screenshots/superbossgaiden.png"],"detailsLink":"/roms/snes/superbossgaiden/","romLink":"/roms/snes/superbossgaiden/superbossgaiden.smc","authorString":"Chrono Moogle and Dieter Von Laser (D4S)","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1}]}}
