    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A hippie guitarist who has visited your small town for years has gone rogue and launched ICBMs toward your town. Break out the fireworks that you had been saving for Independence Day, turn them into makeshift anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), and shoot down the incoming missiles. Each of two silos starts with 15 ABMs. Place the aiming cursor in front of the incoming missile and fire an ABM to destroy it. Defend the town for seven nights (Sunday through Saturday) and you win! Screen shows cursor, missiles, balloon, MIRV, explosions, ammo, score, and time.Game play screen. Click to show or hide names of the game objects. You have to lead your shot a bit because it takes a split second for the ABM to arrive. But the explosion of an ABM is wide enough to destroy several missiles, so aim where the incoming missiles' paths are about to cross. Balloons and multiple independent reentry vehicle (MIRV) missiles will release a payload of multiple missiles if not shot down promptly. At the end of each round, the silos are refilled with ABMs: 15 each or 20 if only one silo remains. A destroyed silo will get rebuilt at the end of a night or once you've lasted one round with no destroyed houses. And if a house has been destroyed, one house will be rebuilt the next day. Later in the week, when more houses are gone, you need not worry about missiles aimed at wreckage. The game is over once both silos or all ten houses have been destroyed, or once you have survived all seven nights.</p>
