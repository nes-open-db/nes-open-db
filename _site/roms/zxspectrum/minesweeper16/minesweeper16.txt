Minesweeper 16/48 (MineSweeper16-v1.0.tap)

Minesweeper is a ZX Spectrum implementation of the classic Minesweeper puzzle, 
familiar to many people as one of the games bundled with Microsoft Windows.

This isn’t the first version of the game for the Spectrum (and probably won’t be the last)
but as far as I can tell from the World of Spectrum database it does seem to be the first version to be playable on a 16K machine!

There are two different versions of Minesweeper – a 16K edition and an enhanced 48K version. 
16K owners can only play the 16K version (obviously) but 48K and 128K users can choose to play either.

The 48K edition features more options (like the ‘Heroes’ mode where the boards are based on 
classic Speccy sprites) and some more polish on the front-end but the game is functionally 
the same regardless of which version you choose, so if you own a grown-up Speccy and just 
want to play classic Minesweeper then the 16K version is a tad faster to load.

The game is my first full project in Z80 machine code, so please go easy on me. :-)

This is release 1.0, slightly tweaked over the beta but still with a few placeholder graphics 
which I drew myself and can only apologise for.
