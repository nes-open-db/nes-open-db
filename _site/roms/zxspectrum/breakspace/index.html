    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Break/Space is a procedurally-generated space strategy game for the 48K ZX Spectrum. After an accident while testing an experimental warp drive, you find yourself stranded in an uncharted area of the universe. Your only chance of getting home is to recover  your four warp cores (jettisoned during the accident) and then return to the wormhole  that brought you here in order to get back to warp speed and back to Earth. Unfortunately this part of the universe is inhabited by six alien races - some nice,  some not-so-nice. You can barter and battle with these as you see fit, although be  careful - your actions will have consequences, and beating up an easy mark can make  them less likely to deal with you the next time your paths cross. Complicating matters more is the fact that your long-range scanners are broken so you  can't see what's ahead of you until you enter a region. Your ship is also a little underpowered and can only carry a certain amount of fuel and armaments. However, it's possible to use the few supplies you have to earn money, which you can then use to replenish stocks or improve your ship. And out in the darkness of space, perhaps there are other opportunities awaiting you? But don't take too long. The wormhole will close soon, and once that happens you'll be trapped here forever!</p>
