In the land of Shinar, the people are building a tower to elevate themselves to the level of God. 
Take on the role of God, and scramble the language of the people and scatter them on the earth! 
Use twitch-style skills to recognize different languages and stop blocks from being added to the 
construction of the tower. Choose from a variety of languages to use, and get the people separated!
