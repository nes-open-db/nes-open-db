You're in a submarine, and you're hot on the trail of another enemy sub. 
It seems to be pulling away from you. The decision was made by your superior to launch Guidance System Magellan, the latest remote-controlled rocket technology in submarine warfare!
Guide the weapon through seaweed to get 100 points and win the day! Use the D-Pad to move left or right.
The game will speed up as you progress further. Good luck!
