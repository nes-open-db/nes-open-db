    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>It's been a while since the nefarious Weka aliens tried to conquer the Earth. Thankfully, Waimanu neutralized their clumsy attack and forced them to flee. Now, however, Wekas are back to resume their unfinished work and this time they've developed a new technology that allows them to materialize stealthily inside unsuspected concrete blocks and teleport magnetically among them, before proceeding to the actual invasion. Obviously, they have underestimated our roundish hero! Waimanu, in fact, doesn't fall into the interplanetary trap hatched by the evil Wekas and, armed with his new Dynamic Fluid CannonDynamic Fluid Cannon(TM), is more than ever determined to fight the treacherous (and gelatinous) space invaders. He will have to chase them through numerous scenarios, driving them out of the blocks and eliminating them once they come out into the open with the help of amazing new weapons that he will collect during his adventure. Will he be able to prevent the fearsome (and quite ridiculous) Wekas from conquering the planet? Waimanu should drive each Weka out of the blocks and eliminate them before the time runs out. Wekas can be eliminated by either shooting at them or by shaking them off the floor. Controls: [Left]/[Right] to move Waimanu, [1] to fire, [2] to shake floor, if shakes are available.</p>
