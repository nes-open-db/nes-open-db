What starts out as a routine hunt for salvage in the far reaches of the galaxy turns into a white-knuckle fight 
for survival in Solar Plexus, the first Atari 2600 release by independent game developer JessCREATIONS*, Co. 
It'll take sharp reflexes to keep your starskimmer full of fuel and away from the wildly unpredictable artificial 
sun which threatens to make every move your last!

The Solar Plexus increases in speed and mutates into new, more dangerous forms as you continue to play. If one 
fiery orb bouncing around the screen was hard enough for you to handle, just wait until you have to deal with two, 
or even three of them! Only the best players will last long enough to witness the final form of this relentless foe.

Solar Plexus can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store. Included with the package is one Solar 
Plexus game cartridge and an eight page instruction manual, featuring helpful gameplay tips and a full-color 
illustration by artist Nathan Strum.
