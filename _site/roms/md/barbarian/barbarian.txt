Barbarian is a 1987 computer platform game by Psygnosis. It was first developed for the Atari ST, and was ported to the Amiga, 
Commodore 64, MS-DOS, MSX, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. 
The Amiga port was released in 1987; the others were released in 1988. Like most early Psygnosis titles, the cover artwork 
(part of "Red Dragon" figure/landscape) was by the popular fantasy artist, Roger Dean.

The game spawned a 1991 sequel, Barbarian II, released alongside Leander, and Ork, other platform-based action-adventures from Psygnosis. 
The game opens with a striking—for the era—animation of a muscle-bound barbarian cutting a chain with a sword. On the Amiga and Atari ST 
versions, the animation is accompanied by a loud, digital sound effect.

In the game, the player is Hegor, a barbarian who must traverse several dungeons and underground habitats to defeat his brother, the evil 
sorcerer Necron. He has a sword and bow in his arsenal of weapons. Running and jumping, as with many platform games, comprises a large part 
of the gameplay of this title.

The game used a unique control system to make up for lack of more than one joystick button on many systems. The player would first press the 
one button after which a "menu" of actions would appear along the bottom of the screen. The player then selected the desired action by cycling 
through the choices with the joystick and then pressing the button again when the desired action was highlighted.

In the original versions, this game tried to emulate the visual style of the game cover and opening animation. The game used very detailed and 
colorful sprites and a variety of thoughtful sound effects to accompany the onscreen action. The DOS version played digitized speech in the 
opening sequence and featured other sound effects using the PC speaker.
