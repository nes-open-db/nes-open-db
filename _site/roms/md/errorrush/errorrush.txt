Error Rush for SEGA Genesis/MegaDrive

The objective of the game is to avoid running into the enemies for as long as you can. One new enemy is spawned every five seconds. 

Use the d-pad to avoid enemies, and hold 'A' to move faster. Touch an enemy and it's game over!

Game ROM image and source code may be freely distributed and re-used if credit is given, but not for commercial use without permission.

Source code is kind of crappy and not well commented. Beware! You can compile the game by running the make.bat file. No external programs needed!

Update April 27, 2016:
Fixed: Illegal instruction on real hardware now works correctly. Thanks for letting me know of the bug, Mask of Destiny!
