In this game, you play as Stephany, who just loves playing games; And since she 
renders everyday life as boring, in modern day, she creates her own virtual world 
to roam around in and enjoy, but not all is happy in this realm, as she will find 
out later on.

Official GitHub repo for Project MD. Here you will find the following stuff:

- /bin ....... Prebuilt binaries
- /minimal ... Minimal source release

TO-DO: full source release that contains the source files to the data, not
just the code. But that will take some time. The minimal release is still
enough to build the game.

It's time for yet another commentary on Royameadow, and this time, we are touching 
what would happen to be one of the greatest Homebrew titles for the Sega Genesis 
and Megadrive of modern day; Possibly one of the most superior Homebrew titles of 
All~Time, when we look at others from over the years. Fellow viewers, welcome to 
Project MD, a Platform Shooter by Sik and Oerg866, originally released in 20I0 in 
the form of prototype builds. Us here at Royameadow know them best for their work 
in the Sonic Hacking scene, while others might know them more from their works in 
Megadrive Homebrew. In this game, you play as Stephany, who just loves playing games; 
And since she renders everyday life as boring, in modern day, she creates her own 
virtual world to roam around in and enjoy, but not all is happy in this realm, as she 
will find out later on. For the sake of this commentary, we will be looking at the 029 
April of 2012 build, of which is the most complete version of the game publicly available 
within Version 03.2I of the GoodGen set; What this version includes that is not present 
in most of the builds before 20II is a (near) complete soundtrack, opening credits, a 
Sapphire Blue title screen (instead of a palette of Purple Mountain's Majesty combined 
with Magenta and Dahlia Purple from the 20II builds), fixed level palettes, more completed 
backgrounds, and bugfixes, of course (if there were any to begin with, that is). 
There is more to mention, but we will leave that to the commentary to tell; In the meanwhile,
if you would like to get Project MD, then feel free to go to either the website on Oerg866's
new website or the forum topic on Sega~0I6, or if you want to view Troy's Vectorman commentary
on SuperTNT '94 that was promoted in this episode, then the respective links are available below.
