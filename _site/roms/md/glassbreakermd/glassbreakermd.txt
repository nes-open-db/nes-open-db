TµEE co.(TM) presents: Glass Braker MD


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first game for my favourite video game system: Sega Mega Drive
(Genesis for North American people). The original PC version of this game is 
Glass Breaker QB, like the name says its written in QB (not QBASIC !!!) plus
tiny amount of 386 optimized assembly. GBMD is not written in BASIC like its 
PC counterpart, its written in 68K ASM and little in Z80 ASM.

Objective, enemies, hints
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective of this game is to break all the windows on the house. It is not
the easiest task because the inhabitants don't let you do it so easily. You
will encounter 5 enemies, each level adds one. 

First enemy is hyper active blind grampa who throws out slippers from a 
broken window. Because he's blind, he doesn't know where you are and throws 
them randomly at random windows that are broken. 

Second enemy you'll encounter is a bird that keeps on trying to shit on you. 
That bird flies slowly near the roof of the house and when it flies above 
you, it drops a present aimed at your head. 

Third enemy, the most pain of them all, is a killer kitty cat who tries to 
scratch your ass of. NOTE: no other enemy likes kitty. 

Fourth enemy is granny, she is ugly and she has a 2 barrel shot gun !!! Just 
pass the door and granny will blast your head off if you don't pass the door 
fast enough. NOTE: granny hates cats (she has allergy).

Fifth enemy is a UFO disquised as a cloud. Granny and gramps are its current 
subjects and it will not let you harm them. UFO tries to cause you terrible
pain and suffering with a low charge protonic beams which are enough to make
you immobilised for days. NOTE: Cats have much weaker body than you.

Try to break upper windows before lower ones and also aim while you move.
If you have taken care of all the windows, you'll complete the level. If
you have better time than in TOP players list you will get the honor of 
entering your name and being in the list yourself. This game hides some 
sectrets in it, you have to do certain actions at certain point of the game 
to reveal them... NOTE: most keyboards don't allow you to open secrets, use 
gamepad like I do ;) Anyone who finds all the secrets and developes for 
MD/Genny can have the FULL source of this game !!!

Thing you should know
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game runs only on European systems with 3 or 6 button controllers. You 
will see notification screen if you run this game on non 50Hz system.
I added 60Hz compatibility in 2013 november. The game will switch to 224 
line res if 60Hz is detected and 240 if 50Hz. Some flashcarts like the Mega 
Everdrive patch the games on the fly and this will cause issues. Turn off 
region patching to avoid problems with this game !
If you happen to see "Back-up RAM error", it means, that SRAM is not present 
or compatible with this game. This error is very unlikely to happen if your
cartridge uses "standard" (what most games and emulator use) SRAM accessing 
technique. You can press start to skip the screen but beware that TOP 5 list
will show some garbage. Directly readable/writable SRAM method is supported.
