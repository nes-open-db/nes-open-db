Pingouin Bleu is a horizontal shmup.
A to shoot
B to switch between three weapons
C to "grab" things, but it's a prototype feature and only works on the red spinning guys. I figured I'd keep it in for fun.

Pick up stars left by defeated enemies to boost your weapon meter. More stars equals upgraded weapons.
