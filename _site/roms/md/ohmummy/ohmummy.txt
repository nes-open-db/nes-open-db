Oh Mummy! Genesis
1985 alternativo 
2012

2-in-1 (port and original version of Amstrad CPC game).

Oh Mummy Genesis is a remake of the classic Oh Mummy by Amstrad. 
This version for Mega Drive was developed by Pocket Lucho, 
recreating the original and adding a totally new game with 
many extras. 

With music by David Sánchez (our Murcian) and cover of David Ayala, 
the game enjoyed great success. While it is true that high demand, 
which we did not expect, came to saturate us completely and force 
us to put the batteries.

About us?
1985 Alternativo is a project formed by a group of enthusiasts who 
remember with nostalgia those years in which video games were much 
more than another big industry. Those times when so many technological 
advances and multimillion-dollar investments were not necessary to 
make us have great moments.
