Star Chaser (sans sound)

OK, a lot of people here probably know about this video:

But I had never released it so far... screw this, here's the game:

The game is pretty much finished except for the complete lack of sound (ouch). 
If some day we can ever get around adding sound to it, I'll update this ROM. 
This game supports the multitap (either the Sega or the EA one) to allow for four players =D

Tech support remark: if you press Reset three times in a row (do it quickly) you'll also 
get a screen to test if the multitap is working (or the joypad ports as-is, if no 
multitap is connected). Before you complain that the game doesn't work well on real hardware 
please check this, because I lost the count of times things "weren't working" because 
a multitap had one of its pins bent =S

Sik is pronounced as "seek", not as "sick".
