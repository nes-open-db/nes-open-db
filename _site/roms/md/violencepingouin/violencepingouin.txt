Hi,

After Goplanes, I worked on another project, called Violence Pingouin.


You can find the source here:

The project layout is a little more complicated than Goplanes. The readme.txt has 
instructions on how to build. It requires the Graphics Gale galefile.dll for it 
to convert .gal files to .c and it's a separate download.

Let me know if you're seeing any problems.

If you just want the binary to play with, you can find it here:

Thanks,
