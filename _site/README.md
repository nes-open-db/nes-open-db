# NES Open DB
A database for freely licensed NES software.

The goals of this project:

* Create an "App Store" type of experience for the NES homebrew software for every major NES emulator out there
* Provide explicit licensing information of each piece of software and metadata distributed on the site
* Provide a machine-readable API that can be accessed by NES emulators to provide beautiful metadata to go along with the game
* Create a promotional platform for NES Homebrew creators who are willing to distribute their homebrew under a permissive license

## How to use data provided by NES Open DB

If you just want to download some ROMs for your personal use, go head! Go browse the `roms\` directory and see what you can find. Grab what you want and start playing :)

However, if you are planning to redistribute the ROMs or metadata in this database, please take these things into account:

*Always* respect the license given along with the data. For example:

* Make sure you attribute the work correctly. Provide information on the author and better yet, link to the author's website.
* If the ROM is GPL and you are allowing direct downloads of the ROM, you must provide a way for the users to also download the source code for the ROM.
* The license for each piece of software is in its own `roms/<name_of_the_game` directory. The MIT License in the root folder applies to the components of the NES Open DB **ONLY**.

## Sounds great! How can I help?

If you are a NES Homebrew developer and want your game listed, you can either send an email (details below) or open up an issue on the issue tracker of this project.

If you are a NES enthusiast that wants to curate the data or help in any other way, please contact me (details below) and tell me what you would like to do.

You can read more about contributing in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document in the root of this project.

Thank you for your support!
